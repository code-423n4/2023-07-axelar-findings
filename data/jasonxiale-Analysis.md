# Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
1) read the documents
2) read the codebase
3) code some test cases
4) read the project's github to look for more function call graph

# Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
1) have a much better understanding about how cross-chain works, and have a little deeper thoughts about the cross-chain than the time for CCIP audits
2) learn new code pattern: `Create3`
