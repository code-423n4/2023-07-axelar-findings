## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
Started by reading the design document in the repository.
Then started to go contract by contract.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
I learnt how the cross chain operations work, and how voting works.

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
I couldn't spend much time on this audit, so the report is a little dry, and hence the basic analysis.
I was also a little demotivated as my highs and mediums for llama audit didnt seem to have make it, despite me creating a proof of concept. I am waiting for the findings report to be made public so I can understand what happened with the findings.


### Time spent:
