## EXPERIENCE
I was really excited to explore the Axelar project and understand its decentralized interoperability network connecting different blockchains, assets, and applications. To start, I quickly skimmed through the project's documentation, spending about 30 minutes to grasp the overall idea and the protocols it used.

After getting an initial feel for the project, I couldn't wait to dive into the codebase. The first contract I encountered was IInterchainGovernance.sol, which was displayed on Code4rena. From there, I went on a thorough examination of the code, constantly making notes and marking potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement using the Collanote application on my iPad.

When I didn't have my iPad with me, I utilized the "Solidity Visual Developer" extension and strategically placed /// @audit comments in the code to remind myself of the areas that required a closer look. This way, whenever I revisited the codebase, those points would immediately stand out in red.

I spent a good 4.5 hours meticulously analyzing the code and taking note of potential vulnerabilities. Afterward, I categorized the vulnerabilities by their severity levels (gas/low/med/high) and began testing with Foundry, focusing primarily on the potential medium-level issues. I didn't test for any high-level vulnerabilities since I believed the unverified address issue was a medium rather than a high.

This whole process took me an additional 2 hours. Currently, I am working on compiling all the vulnerabilities I found into well-organized reports with relevant links. I estimate spending another 2 hours on this task, resulting in a total of 9 hours dedicated to the project. I know it's not a lot of time, but I'm making the most out of my vacation to maintain a steady pace of work! :D
## Lesson Learned
Talking about lesson learned,mainly two:
Patience and attention to detail are crucial: Throughout the audit, I realized that reading and analyzing complex contracts require a patient approach and rigorous attention to detail. Even a small oversight or lack of attention could lead to serious consequences, especially when it comes to security and vulnerabilities.

Prioritizing Tasks: Not all tasks have the same level of importance or urgency. By prioritizing critical and high-impact tasks first, I ensured that potential vulnerabilities were addressed promptly and efficiently.
