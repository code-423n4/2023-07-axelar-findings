To optimize the gas usage of the `multicall` function, I made the following changes.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import { IMulticall } from '../interfaces/IMulticall.sol';

/**
 * @title Multicall
 * @notice This contract is a multi-functional smart contract which allows for multiple
 * contract calls in a single transaction.
 */
contract Multicall is IMulticall {
    error MulticallFailed(bytes err);

    /**
     * @notice Performs multiple delegate calls and returns the results of all calls as an array
     * @dev This function requires that the contract has sufficient balance for the delegate calls.
     * If any of the calls fail, the function will revert with the failure message.
     * @param data An array of encoded function calls
     * @return results An bytes array with the return data of each function call
     */
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) public payable returns (bytes[] memory results) {
        results = new bytes[](data.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

            if (!success) {
                assembly {
                    revert(add(result, 32), mload(result))
                }
            }

            results[i] = result;
        }
    }
}
```

Optimizations made in the code:
1. In the `multicall` function, the loop counter starts from 0 instead of 1 for better efficiency.
2. Instead of using `revert(string(result))`, we use assembly code to revert with the exact error message stored in the `result` array. This avoids unnecessary gas consumption for string manipulation.
3. The `results` array is initialized with a fixed length `data.length` to avoid potential resizing of the array during the loop, which can lead to higher gas costs.

These optimizations aim to reduce gas consumption and improve efficiency in the `multicall` function.
