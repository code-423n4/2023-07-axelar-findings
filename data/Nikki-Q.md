In the contract [Operatable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-axelar/blob/main/contracts/its/utils/Operatable.sol#L14-L15), there appears to be a discrepancy between the value assigned to the constant `OPERATOR_SLOT` and the value mentioned in the associated comments. The comment states that the assigned value is the result of the operation `uint256(keccak256('operator')) - 1`, which should yield a different value than the one provided in the initialization of `OPERATOR_SLOT`.

```solidity 
contract Operatable is IOperatable {
    // uint256(keccak256('operator')) - 1 
    uint256 internal constant OPERATOR_SLOT = 0xf23ec0bb4210edd5cba85afd05127efcd2fc6a781bfed49188da1081670b22d7;

 ...
}
```

Based on the calculation `uint256(keccak256('operator')) - 1`, the correct value should be `0x46a52cf33029de9f84853745a87af28464c80bf0346df1b32e205fc73319f621`.

Therefore, there seems to be a discrepancy between the comment and the actual value assigned to OPERATOR_SLOT. The comment's explanation of how the value is derived is either incorrect or the value itself might have been mistakenly copied and pasted. A careful review of the code is necessary to determine the accurate value and ensure consistency between the comments and the code implementation.
