#Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
-Started by understanding the purpose of the project and its intended functionality through the doc. 
-Identified the business logic and the roles and permissions of various contracts within the system. 
-Then I looked at the codes in scope line by line
-Constantly revisited the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
-Discussed some of my ideas about a potential vulnerability findings with those that have better experience to get 
 their take.
-Did my work slowly but steadily and also consistently in order to avoid work overload at the very last 
 minute.

#Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
I have learnt quite a lot from this project. I will list quite a few:
-Cross-Chain Interoperability
-Proxy Contracts and Upgradability
-Critical Edge Cases Handling
-Multisig
-Learnt about Canonical Bridges and Custom Bridges
-Improved communicative and collaborative skills 
-Proper documentation and comments within the codebase

#Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
As a junior auditor auditing my second project, I approached this task of auditing smart contracts with dedication and enthusiasm. While I may have made some mistakes and encountered difficulties in the process, I saw this as a valuable learning opportunity to improve my skills in identifying potential vulnerabilities. I scrutinized the code base and focused on understanding the contract logic and security implications. Despite being new to the field, I remained diligent and committed to conducting a thorough analysis. I recognize that there is always room for improvement, and I am eager to receive feedback for continuous growth.
