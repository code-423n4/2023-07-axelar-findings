# Approach
My approach towards auditing Axelar Network is first going through design docs to understand the working of the whole codebase of the project.
Then i go for gas and QA to lookout for areas that were left by the automated findings but still have crucial importance to reduce gas and improve code quality.

# Learning
My learning from this project is related to go through line by line code and connect all the dots which helps in getting deeper understanding of any project.
# Comments
My approach towards this project is related to finding any issues that are linked to causing issues in project working or causing anomaly in interchain process. This helps me in getting a medium vulnerability related to stucking of funds due to empty receive of funds.
