Since most of the hacks that I've read of involved bridges, it was nice and very instructive, as a beginner, to have a chance to look for bugs in one. For that same reason I tried to focus mostly on the ITS aspect leaving 2/3 days for the governance parts.
For one of my findings I haven't provided a coded PoC, since the issue revolved around the lack of a functionality and I could think of a way to express that in a script, hopefully this won't cause troubles in evaluating it.
Also this is the first time I submit a QA report alongside high/meds reports and I'm really looking forward for feedback when the report eventually comes out.
All the analysis was done manually.
