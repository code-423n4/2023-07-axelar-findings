Advanced Analysis

Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings:
I found DOS on this project which I have successfully found before on another project.

Approach taken in evaluating the codebase:
1. Use Mythx to search for bugs.
2. Once medium or high bug found then write exploit code for it.
3. If Low or non critical bug then perform writeup.
4. Then submit.

Architecture recommendations:
Utilize AI more.

Codebase quality analysis:
Use quotes instead of apostrophes.
There are a lot of floating pragmas.

Centralization risks:
When staking avoid monopoly by capping individual limits as a percentage, but over time the limit can increase.

Mechanism review:
Most of the code files seem secure enough.  
There are recurring security issues with rarely a DOS.  
But mostly, the issues are floating pragmas.

Systemic risks:
I do not see a risk of an overall structure breakdown. 
Just the odd denial of service on ConstAddressDeployer solidity file.
