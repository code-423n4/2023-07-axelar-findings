### Axelar Q/A Report by K42

1 possible Q/A optimization in the [FlowLimit.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-axelar/blob/main/contracts/its/utils/FlowLimit.sol) contract:  Use of ``block.number`` instead of ``block.timestamp`` for epoch calculation.

- In the [_addFlowOut](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-axelar/blob/main/contracts/its/utils/FlowLimit.sol#L111C1-L118C6) and [_addFlowIn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-axelar/blob/main/contracts/its/utils/FlowLimit.sol#L124C3-L131C6) functions, the epoch is calculated using [block.timestamp / EPOCH_TIME](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-axelar/blob/main/contracts/its/utils/FlowLimit.sol#L114C8-L114C54). However, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners to a certain degree, which could potentially affect the accuracy of the epoch calculation. Instead, using ``block.number`` could be a safer and more predictable way to calculate epochs, assuming an average block time.

Before Optimization:




```solidity
uint256 epoch = block.timestamp / EPOCH_TIME;
```




After Optimization: 




```solidity
uint256 epoch = block.number / BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH;
```




where ``BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH`` is a constant that represents the average number of blocks per epoch. For example, if ``EPOCH_TIME`` is 6 hours, and the average block time is 15 seconds, BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH would be 6 * 60 * 60 / 15 = 1440.
