# Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
Manual review, solodit


# Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
functionalities found in popular/industry standard libraries are created from scratch/reinvented/ tweaked whereas they could have been built upon using these standard libraries as base. 

# Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
look at my findings from a view of input/output validations, possible edge cases, especially in external functions/ functions using args in their logic.
